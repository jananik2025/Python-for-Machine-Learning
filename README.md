# Python-for-Machine-Learning
This repository hosts a modular Python implementation of the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm applied to the Iris dataset. Designed to demonstrate production-level best practices, it bridges the gap between theory and practice by incorporating robust preprocessing, scientific hyperparameter tuning, and advanced visualization
